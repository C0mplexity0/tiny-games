This will open the games folder.

Now you can head to https://github.com/C0mplexity0/tiny-games-template and either clone the repository into the games folder, or just download the code and extract it into the games folder. Feel free to name this folder whatever you want.

Now you can click the refresh button and it should appear with this screen:
