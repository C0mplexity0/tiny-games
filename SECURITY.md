# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any security vulnerabilities with Tiny Games, you should report them ASAP through GitHub's Advisory tab (located [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/new)).

Sadly I cannot guarantee how quickly security issues will be dealt with, but I will try to respond to any issues as quickly as possible.
